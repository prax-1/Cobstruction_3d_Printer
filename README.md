# Construction 3d Printer
 Welcome to the Construction 3D Printer project repository!

 ## Overview
 This project focuses on the development of a construction 3D printer, leveraging Klipper firmware and a Makerbase SKR board. The printer is designed to fabricate large-scale structures using additive manufacturing techniques, revolutionizing the construction industry with its efficiency and flexibility.

 ## Features
- Klipper Firmware: The printer utilizes Klipper firmware for smooth and efficient control of the hardware components, ensuring precise movement and accurate prints
- Makerbase SKR Board: The Makerbase SKR board serves as the central control unit for the printer, providing connectivity and processing power to manage the printing process effectively.
- Large-scale Printing: With its robust construction and spacious build volume, the printer is capable of fabricating structures of considerable size, making it ideal for construction applications.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Klipper Firmware: Begin by flashing the Klipper firmware onto the Makerbase SKR board following the instructions provided in the Klipper documentation.
2. Assemble Printer Components: Assemble the printer components including the frame, motors, extruder, and bed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Connect Electronics: Connect the Makerbase SKR board to the printer's electronic components, ensuring all connections are secure and properly configured.
4. Configure Klipper: Configure Klipper firmware settings to match the specifications of your printer, including motor steps, end-stop positions, and printer dimensions.
5. Calibration and Testing: Perform calibration procedures such as bed leveling and extruder calibration to ensure accurate printing. Test the printer with small-scale prints before proceeding to larger projects.
